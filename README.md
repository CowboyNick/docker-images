Docker-Images
=============
Here's a collection of docker images I have built:

* 389-ds: a barebones, CentOS 6-based, 389-ds instance that comes with a minimal users database. Perfect for integration tests needing an ldap.

* openldap: a barebones Ubuntu-based, openldap instance that comes with a minimal users database. Perfect for integration tests needing an ldap.
