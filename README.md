Docker-Images
=============
Here's a collection of docker images I have built:

* docker-389-ds: a barebones 389-ds instance that comes with a minimal users database. Perfect for integration tests needing an ldap.

* docker-openldap: a barebones openldap instance that comes with a minimal users database. Perfect for integration tests needing an ldap.
